Further development of CAPMC service or CLI has stopped. CAPMC has entered end-of-life but will still be generally available. CAPMC is going to be replaced with the Power Control Service (PCS) in a future release. The current API/CLI portfolio for CAPMC are being pruned to better align with the future direction of PCS. More information about PCS and the CAPMC transition will be released as part of subsequent CSM releases.\n\nThe API endpoints that remain un-deprecated will remain supported until their 'phased transition' into PCS (e.g. Power Capping is not 'deprecated' and will be supported in PCS; As PCS is developed, CAPMC's Powercapping and PCS's Powercapping will both function, eventually callers of the CAPMC power capping API/CLI will need to will need transition to call PCS as the API will be different.)\n\nHere is a list of deprecated API (CLI) endpoints:\n* node control  \n  * `/get_node_rules`\n  * `/get_node_status`\n  * `/node_on`\n  * `/node_off`\n  * `/node_reinit`\n* group control\n  * `/group_reinit`\n  * `/get_group_status`\n  * `/group_on`\n  * `/group_off`\n* node energy\n  * `/get_node_energy`\n  * `/get_node_energy_stats`\n  * `/get_node_energy_counter`\n* system monitor\n  * `/get_system_parameters`\n  * `/get_system_power`\n  * `/get_system_power_details`\n* EPO\n  * `/emergency_power_off`  \n* utilities\n  * `/get_nid_map`\n\n## Introduction\nThe Cray Advanced Platform Monitoring and Control (CAPMC) API provides remote power monitoring and control to agents running externally to the Cray System Management Services.\n\nThese controls enable external software to manage the power state of an entire system and to more intelligently manage systemwide power consumption. The following API calls are provided as a means for third party software to implement power control and management strategies as simple or complex as the site-level requirements demand. The simplest power management strategy may be to simply turn off components which may be idle for a significant time interval and turn them back on when demand increases.\n\nThis implementation of CAPMC uses Redfish APIs to communicate directly with the hardware. Furthermore, all CAPMC power commands should be viewed as **asynchronous** and require the client to check for status after a CAPMC API call returns.\n## Controls\n### component control\n\n  CAPMC component power controls implement a simple interface for powering\n  off or on components (chassis, modules, nodes), and querying component\n  state information using component identifiers known as xnames. These\n  controls enable external software to more intelligently manage systemwide\n  power consumption or configuration parameters.\n\n### node control (deprecated CSM 1.0 - removed CSM 1.3)\n\n  CAPMC node power controls implement a simple interface for powering on\n  or off nodes, querying node state information, and querying site-specific\n  service usage rules. These controls enable external software to more\n  intelligently manage systemwide power consumption or configuration\n  parameters. The simplest power management strategy may be to simply turn\n  off compute nodes which may be idle for a significant time interval and\n  turn them back on when demand increases. The node control API calls are\n  provided as a means for third party software to implement power management\n  strategies as simple or complex as the site-level requirements demand.\n\n### group control (deprecated CSM 1.0 - removed CSM 1.3)\n\n  CAPMC group power controls implement a simple interface for querying\n  component state and controlling the power of components that are part of a\n  predefined group. Component groups are defined in the Hardware State\n  Manager. These controls enable external software to more intelligently\n  manage systemwide power consumption or configuration parameters.\n\n### power capping\n\n  CAPMC power capping controls implement a simple interface for\n  querying component capabilities and manipulation of node or sub-node\n  (accelerator) power constraints. This functionality enables external\n  software to establish an upper bound, or estimate a minimum bound, on\n  the amount of power a system or a select subset of the system may\n  consume. The power capping API calls are provided as a means for third\n  party software to implement advanced power management strategies.\n\n### utilities (partially deprecated CSM 1.0 - removed CSM 1.3)\n\n  CAPMC also contains utility functions used to query information such as\n  component name mapping, system partition membership, or a node\\'s role\n  assignment. The client utility may also function in an HTTP pass-through\n  mode, effectively allowing a client to specify custom input payloads not\n  possible using command line arguments alone. This mode of operation offers\n  maximum flexibility while allowing the client to utilize capmc\\'s built in\n  authorization mechanism.\n\n### node energy (deprecated CSM 1.0 - removed CSM 1.3)\n\n  CAPMC energy reporting controls implement a simple interface for querying\n  node energy consumption in various ways. The client may query statistics\n  by application id, job id, or simply use a list of NID numbers and a\n  client specified time window. Types of information returned may include\n  aggregated energy usage on a set of nodes, energy usage per-node, or an\n  energy accumulator point in time snapshot.\n\n  **Note:** API calls backed by data from the power management database\n  (PMDB), `get_node_energy`, `get_node_energy_stats`, and\n  `get_node_energy_counter`, are subject to a\n  [hysteresis](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hysteresis) constraint. The\n  hysteresis value is 15 seconds; so all data sets returned from those API\n  calls will be shifted back in time so that the end time is less than the\n  hystersis window. The minimum window of time that may be queried is 15\n  seconds. Furthermore, all aggregation of data over the time dimension will\n  first be aggregated in 15s time windows. These constraints ensure high\n  data quality and minimize the impact of hysteresis on API calls.\n\n  **Warning:** The `get_node_energy` and `get_node_energy_stats` API calls\n  are resource intensive. Depending on system size and input parameters,\n  those API calls may require several minutes to complete.\n\n### system monitor (deprecated CSM 1.0 - removed CSM 1.3)\n\n  CAPMC system level monitoring controls implement a simple interface for\n  monitoring near real time system level power consumption. Current or\n  historical power data may be selected. This data may be returned in\n  aggregate or constituent form containing information relating to total\n  system or per-cabinet components, respectively. Additionally, a mechanism\n  is provided for a system administrator to convey intent or other\n  operational parameters, such as a maximum system power limit, or\n  unreported static power overhead, to third-parties.\n\n  **Note:** API calls backed by data from the power management database\n  (PMDB), `get_system_power` and `get_system_power_details`, are subject to\n  a hysteresis constraint. The hysteresis value is 15 seconds; so all data\n  sets returned from those API calls will be shifted back in time so that\n  the end time is less than the hystersis window. The minimum window of time\n  that may be queried is 15 seconds. Furthermore, all aggregation of data\n  over the time dimension will first be aggregated in 15s time windows.\n  These constraints ensure high data quality and minimize the impact of\n  hysteresis on API calls.\n\n### EPO (deprecated CSM 1.0 - removed CSM 1.3)\n\n  CAPMC EPO controls implement a simple interface for issuing a software\n  driven emergency power off. This causes a hard power off for all\n  components that can have their power directly controlled. This API should\n  not be used for routine power control of the system.\n\n  **Note:** EPO is only available at the system, cabinet, and chassis\n  component levels for Mountain hardware. All mountain hardware that shares\n  a cooling group with a component that is EPO'd will also be EPO'd.\n\n  **Warning:** Manual steps are required to recover from this and all EPOs.",

Default rules are supplied where appropriate.\n\nOther values such as the maximum node counts for `node_on` or `node_off` and the maximum amount of time a node should remain off after a power down are left unset. The values are not strictly enforced by Cray system management software. They are meant to provide guidelines for authorized clients in their use of the CAPMC service.",

The data returned informs the client of how long `node_on` and `node_off` operations are expected to take, the minimum amount of time nodes should be left off to save energy, and limits on the number of nodes that should be turned on or off at once. Default rules are supplied where appropriate.\n\nOther values such as the maximum node counts for `node_on` or `node_off` and the maximum amount of time a node should remain off after a power down are left unset. The values are not strictly enforced by Cray system management software. They are meant to provide guidelines for authorized clients in their use of the CAPMC service.",

                "description": "The `get_node_status` API returns component state for all nodes or a subset of nodes as specified by a nid list and/or state filter. This status API is intended, but not limited, to be used in conjunction with operations which may modify node component state, such as `node_on` or `node_off`.\n\nBy default, the status returned from this API reports the component states as reported by the Hardware State Manager (HSM). An optional `source` parameter may be passed in the request body to report the hardware states as reported by Redfish (**on** or **off**).\n\nThe `get_node_status` API does not report **empty** components.\n\n**Filters**\n\nFilters for a status query may be supplied as a pipe-separated (|) list surrounded with double quotes, e.g. \"filter1|filter2|filter3\". Valid filters are: `show_all`, `show_off`, `show_on`, `show_halt`, `show_standby`, `show_ready`, and `show_disabled`. Valid flag filters are `show_alert`, `show_resvd`, and `show_warn`. Status and flag filters may be intermixed freely. The `show_all` filter overrides any other status or flag filters and is the default.\n\n**Notice**\n\nThe hardware management system no longer supports a \"diag\" state, as such the `show_diag` filter is considered deprecated. Specifying only the `show_diag` filter will not return any results.",

Once restarted, the selected nodes will automatically start to boot with a discovery image or a previously configured image. Not all nodes support a **restart**, in these cases, the API may issue an **off** and then **on** to those components.\n\nThe `node_reinit` API will return after a power **restart** or **off-on** sequence is attempted to be sent to all of the selected components. The return payload should be examined as it may indicate components that did not receive the power request due to an error. The API may return immediately on an error containing a status result indicating any error encountered. The client must determine overall command status by calling the `get_node_status` API after this call returns.\n\nAn optional text message may be provided describing the reason for performing the `node_reinit` operation.",

If an `apid` or `job_id` are supplied, the running counters for each node associated with the respective id will be returned. If a list of NIDs is supplied, then the counters for the nodes corresponding to the supplied NID list will be returned.\n\nOne and only one of `apid`, `job_id`, or `nids` list must be specified. If a time value is specified, then the query will retrieve the energy counters at or very near the specified time (if available, within one second). Otherwise, the most recent energy counter value will be returned that has occured outside the hysteresis window.\n\nThis API returns a free running energy counter for each of the target NIDs. In order to be meaningful, such as when computing average power or energy consumed over a time interval, multiple calls must be made such that the client can perform calculations based on the difference in returned energy counter values.",

An optional `source` parameter may be passed in the request body to report the states defined by the Cray Hardware Management System (HMS) software.\n\nThe `get_xname_status` API does not report **empty** components.\n\n**Filters**\n\nFilters for a status query may be supplied as a pipe-separated (|) list surrounded with double quotes, e.g. \"filter1|filter2|filter3\". Valid filters are: `show_all`, `show_off`, `show_on`, `show_halt`, `show_standby`, `show_ready`, and `show_disabled`. Valid flag filters are `show_alert`, `show_resvd`, and `show_warn`. Status and flag filters may be intermixed freely. The `show_all` filter overrides any other status or flag filters and is the default.\n\n**Notice**\n\nThe hardware management system no longer supports a \"diag\" state, as such the `show_diag` filter is considered deprecated.

These power operations are ordered to allow large sets of components to be reinit'd with a single API call. Not all components support a **restart**, in these cases, the API may issue an **off** and then **on** to those components.\n\nThe `xname_reinit` API will return after a power **restart** or **off-on** sequence is attempted to be sent to all of the selected components. The return payload should be examined as it may indicate components that did not receive the power request due to an error. The API may return immediately on an error containing a status result indicating any error encountered. The client must determine overall command status by calling the `get_xname_status` API after this call returns.\n\n`xname_reinit` accepts **all** and **s0** as valid xnames indicating all components in the system.\n\nAn optional text message may be provided describing the reason for performing the `xname_reinit` operation.",

The return payload should be examined as it may indicate components that did not receive the power **on** request due to an error. The API may return immediately on an error containing a status result indicating the error encountered. The client must determine overall command status by calling the `get_xname_status` API after this call returns.\n\n`xname_on` accepts **all** and **s0** as valid xnames indicating all components in the system.\n\nAn optional text message may be provided describing the reason for performing the `xname_on` operation.",

These power operations are ordered to allow large sets of components to be reinit'd with a single API call. Not all components support a **restart**, in these cases, the API may issue an **off** and then **on** to those components. If nodes are part of the groups being restarted, those nodes will automatically start to boot with a discovery image or a previously configured image.\n\nThe `group_reinit` API will return after a power **restart** or **off-on** sequence is attempted to be sent to all of the selected components. The return payload should be examined as it may indicate components that did not receive the power request due to an error. The API may return immediately on an error containing a status result indicating any error encountered. The client must determine overall command status by calling the `get_group_status` API after this call returns.\n\nAn optional text message may be provided describing the reason for performing the `group_reinit` operation.",

This status API is intended, but not limited, to be used in conjunction with asynchronous operations which may modify the state of components in a group, such as `group_on` or `group_off`.\n\nThe status returned from this API are the hardware states as reported by Redfish (**on** or **off**).\n\nThe `get_group_status` API does not report **empty** components.\n\nGroups queried via the `get_group_status` API must be defined in Hardware State Manager.\n\n**Filters**\n\nFilters for a status query may be supplied as a pipe-separated (|) list surrounded with double quotes, e.g. \"filter1|filter2|filter3\". Valid filters are: `show_all`, `show_off`, `show_on`, `show_halt`, `show_standby`, `show_ready`, and `show_disabled`. Valid flag filters are `show_alert`, `show_resvd`, and `show_warn`. Status and flag filters may be intermixed freely. The `show_all` filter overrides any other status or flag filters and is the default.\n\n**Notice**\n\nThe hardware management system no longer supports a \"diag\" state, as such the `show_diag` filter is considered deprecated. Specifying only the `show_diag` filter will not return any results.",
