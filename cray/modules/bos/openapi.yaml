# Cray Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) API Specification
openapi: "3.0.2"

info:
  title: "Boot Orchestration Service"
  version: "0.0.0-api"
  description: |
    The Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) provides coordinated provisioning actions
    over defined hardware sets to enable boot, reboot, shutdown, configuration and
    staging for specified hardware subsets. These provisioning actions apply state
    through numerous system management APIs at the request of system administrators
    for managed product environments.

    The default content type for the BOS API is "application/json". Unsuccessful
    API calls return a content type of "application/problem+json" as per RFC 7807.

    ## Resources


    ### /sessiontemplate

    A session template sets the operational context of which nodes to operate on for
    any given set of nodes. It is largely comprised of one or more boot
    sets and their associated software configuration.

    A boot set defines a list of nodes, the image you want to boot/reboot the nodes with,
    kernel parameters to use to boot the nodes, and additional configuration management
    framework actions to apply during node bring up.

    ### /session

    A BOS session applies a provided action to the nodes defined in a session
    template.

    ## Workflow


    ### Create a New Session

    #### GET /sessiontemplate

    List available session templates.
    Note the *name* which uniquely identifies each session template.
    This value can be used to create a new session later,
    if specified in the request body of POST /session.

    #### POST /sessiontemplate

    If no session template pre-exists that satisfies requirements,
    then create a new session template. *name* uniquely identifies the
    session template.
    This value can be used to create a new session later,
    if specified in the request body of POST /session.

    #### POST /session

    Specify template_name and an
    operation to create a new session.
    The template_name corresponds to the session template *name*.
    A new session is launched as a result of this call.

    A limit can also be specified to narrow the scope of the session. The limit
    can consist of nodes, groups, or roles in a comma-separated list.
    Multiple groups are treated as separated by OR, unless "&" is added to
    the start of the component, in which case this becomes an AND.  Components
    can also be preceded by "!" to exclude them.

    Note, the response from a successful session launch contains *links*.
    Within *links*, *href* is a string that uniquely identifies the session.
    *href* is constructed using the session template name and a generated UUID.
    Use the entire *href* string as the path parameter *session_id*
    to uniquely identify a session in for the /session/{session_id}
    endpoint.


    #### GET /session/{session_id}

    Get session details by session id.

    List all in progress and completed sessions.


    ## Interactions with Other APIs


    BOS works in concert with Image Management Service (IMS) to access boot images,
    and if *enable_cfs* is true then
    BOS will invoke CFS to configure the compute nodes.


    All boot images specified via the session template, must be available via IMS.

        A session template is used to create a Session which when combined with an
        action (i.e. boot, reconfigure, reboot, shutdown) will create a Kubernetes BOA job
        to complete the required tasks for the operation.

        A Session Template can be created from a JSON structure.  It will return
        a SessionTemplate name if successful.
        This name is required when creating a Session.
