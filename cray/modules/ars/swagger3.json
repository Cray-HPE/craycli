        "description": "The Artifact Repository Service is a general purpose binary object management service that is used for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting binary blobs available to the System Management Services.  \n\nThe types of binary objects that can be managed with this service include,   but are not limited to, bootable images, docker images, OS packages, and firmware images.  Along with the binary images, metadata about using the artifact, such as versioning and  download location is also stored in the ARS.\n\nARS is used by System Administrators or Application Developers who want to create  utilities on top of the API. \n# Resources\n## /artifacts  \n  Manage an ArtifactRecord. Allows you to create an ArtifactRecord. The ArtifactRecord \n  stores the location of an artifact once it has been uploaded as well as the \n  associated metadata, described in the ArtifactRecord request body. \n  Required fields include the name of the artifact, the type of artifact \n  (limited to `generic`, `kernel`, and `initrd`), and the version.\n\n## /uploads  \nManage an UploadRequest. Allows you to create an upload request for an  artifact and then upload the artifact to the ARS. You can also delete an upload  request by upload_id.\n# Workflow  \n\n\n This workflow describes how you can upload an artifact in ARS: \n\n* POST /artifacts - Create a new artifact record in the ARS. Note **artifact_id**. \n* POST /uploads - Create a new upload request and use artifact_id from previous step. \n  Note **upload_id**. The value of upload_id is same as artifact_id. \n\n* PUT /uploads/{upload_id} - Upload an artifact to the upload request and use upload_id \n  from previous step.   \n  \n* GET /uploads/{upload_id} - Retrieve information about the upload request by upload_id. \n  This step is optional and may be used to confirm that the upload succeeded or to view \n  the current state of the upload.\n\n* GET /artifacts/{artifact_id} - Retrieve the artifact record and get the download\n  location (uri).\n\n\nThe default content type for the ARS API is \"application/json\". Unsuccessful API calls return a content type of \"application/problem+json\" as per RFC 7807."
