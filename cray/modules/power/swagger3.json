PCS refers to system components by their xname, or system identifier. \n\nThis REST API provides the following functions:\n* Turn xnames on or off.\n* Perform hard and soft reset actions.\n* Set and retrieve power capping parameters and capabilities.\n* Get node rules which are various parameters relating to power operations.\n\n## Resources\n### /transitions\nPower xname on or off.\n### /power-status\nGet power status of xnames.\n### /power-cap\n### /power-cap-snapshot\nGet and set power capping parameters.\n## Workflows\n### Set Power Cap for a list of targets\n#### PATCH /power-cap\nSend a JSON payload with a list of targets and power capping parameters to be applied to the targets.  This is a non-blocking operation. A task ID is returned, used to query the status of the task and get the requested information.\n### Get Power Cap status and information for a power cap task\n#### GET /power-cap/{taskID}\nRetrieve status of specified power cap PATCH operation and current values.\n### Get Power Cap parameters and capabilities for a list of targets\n#### POST /power-cap/snapshot\nSend a JSON payload with a list of target xnames.  This will launch a task and return a snapshot ID which can be queried for status.\n### Get status and current Power Cap settings from recent power cap snapshot\n#### GET /power-cap/{taskID}\nQuery the status of a power cap snapshot task.  If completed, contains the current power cap values as read from the hardware."
